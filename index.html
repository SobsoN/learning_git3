	<h1>Metallica - Enter Sandman</h1>
	<p class="first-paragraph">
		Say your prayers little one Don't forget, my son To include everyone Tuck you in, warm within Keep you free from sin Till the sandman he comes Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tight Exit light Enter night Take my hand Off to never never land
	</p>
	<p class="second-paragraph">
		Now I lay me down to sleep (Now I lay me down to sleep) Pray the Lord my soul to keep (Pray the Lord my soul to keep) If I die before I wake (If I die before I wake) Pray the Lord my soul to take (Pray the Lord my soul to take) Hush little baby, don't say a word And never mind that noise you heard It's just the beast under your bed In your closet, in your head Exit light Enter night Grain of sand
	</p>
	<p class="third-paragraph">
		Something's wrong, shut the light Heavy thoughts tonight And they aren't of snow white Dreams of war, dreams of liars Dreams of dragon's fire And of things that will bite Sleep with one eye open Gripping your pillow tight Exit light Enter night Take my hand Off to never never land
